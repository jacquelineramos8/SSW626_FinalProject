# SSW626_FinalProject
Final Project for SSW626 Fall semester 2021

This repo contains my program, csv data file, and written report for my final project "Predicting COVID-19 Safety Regulation Compliance".

The project reads demographic and survey data from a csv file and creates a classifier to predict one's Covid-19 safety measure compliance level.
